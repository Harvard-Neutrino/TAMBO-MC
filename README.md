# Hola y bienvenidos.
Welcome to TAMBOSim! This quickstart guide will show you how to install TAMBOSim and run your first TAMBO simulation. Some of the functions and utilities we will go over have docstrings in the code, but many others do not. With that in mind, if things don't work, or there is a change you would like to see, or something is just annoying but you don't know what the fix would look like, please feel free to create an [issue in the GitHub repo](https://github.com/Harvard-Neutrino/TAMBO-MC/issues). You should also feel free to email [Jeff Lazar](mailto:jlazar@icecube.wisc.edu) or [Will Thompson](mailto:will_thompson@g.harvard.edu). If you feel up to it, you can fork this repo, make the change, and initiate a pull request yourself.

Lastly, please don’t hesitate to get in contact with us if you run into any problems along the way. We’d love to help you get your simulation running.

Alright, let's get things moving!

## [0] Prerequisites
### [0.1] Jump into Julia
The code reies mostly on the Julia language so you will need to install that. This was developed using Julia version 1.11. Get that one if you can, but more recent versions should work fine. You can find instructions for installing Julia [here](https://julialang.org/install/). 

If you are new to Julia, it’s borderline life-changing, but there are definitely some differences from Python. To run the code, you won't need anything advanced, but it might be good to dip you toes into some of the basics. When I started with Julia, I had a decent handle on Python, and I used [these resources](https://github.com/JuliaAcademy/JuliaTutorials) to fill in the gaps. There were still some growing pains, but I felt it gave me enough information to get started. The Julia manual also has a dedicated page on
[difference from Python](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/noteworthy-differences/#Noteworthy-differences-from-Python).

Also, I highly recommend joining the [Julia Slack](https://julialang.org/slack/). It is very active, and everyone there is extremely helpful. 

### [0.2] CORSIKA 8
TAMBOSim also relies on the new C++ implementation of CORSIKA, CORSIKA 8. We assume here that you have installed and built CORSIKA 8; you can find instructions for doing so [here](https://gitlab.iap.kit.edu/AirShowerPhysics/corsika).

## [1] Installing Dependencies
The physics of TAMBOSim relies primarily on three external software packages: PROPOSAL, TauRunner, and CORSIKA. PROPOSAL and TauRunner can both be run using Python. Of course we are using Julia, not Python, so we will interface with these packages using the Julia package PyCall. CORSIKA, in contrast, is written in C++. TAMBOSim interfaces directly with the CORSIKA executable, so it must be compiled directly, which will be covered later in this section.

We have found that the most straightforward way to get the Python dependencies to play nice in TAMBOSim is by setting up a clean Python virtual environment, or venv. Let’s do that first.

### [1.1] Python venv
We’ll assume that you have a relatively recent version of Python installed. We have found that version 3.12.4 works well, but other relatively modern versions should work fine too. Create a fresh venv by running `python -m venv /path/to/tambo_venv`. Go ahead and activate this venv using `source /path/to/tambo_venv/bin/activate`.

### [1.2] PROPOSAL
PROPOSAL is the library that we use to propoagate charged leptons and is easiest to install using pip. Run `pip install proposal` to install it.

### [1.3] TauRunner
TauRunner is used to propagate high-energy tau neturinos thought the Earth, taking into account the effects of [tau regeneration](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.hep-ph/9804354).  To install it, you will need to directly clone the [TauRunner repo](https://github.com/icecube/TauRunner.git). After cloning the repo, install TauRunner by running `pip install /path/to/TauRunner`.

### [1.4] CORSIKA TAMBO application
In addition to building and installing CORISKA8, you will need to build the specific CORSIKA application that is used to simulate air showers in TAMBOSim. This ships with TAMBOSim, so go ahead and clone this repo. Next, navigate to `/path/to/TAMBOSim/src/corsika/`. In this directory, execute the following:
```
mkdir build

export CORSIKA_PREFIX=/path/to/corsika8/top/level/directory
export CONAN_DEPENDENCIES=${CORSIKA_PREFIX}/corsika-install/lib/cmake/dependencies
export FLUPRO=/path/to/fluka/top/level/directory
export FLUFOR=<name of FORTRAN you built CORSIKA against, like gfortran>
export WITH_FLUKA=ON

cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=${CONAN_DEPENDENCIES}/conan_toolchain.cmake \
    -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=${CONAN_DEPENDENCIES} \
    -DCMAKE_POLICY_DEFAULT_CMP0091=NEW \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo \
    -Dcorsika_DIR=${CORSIKA_PREFIX}/corsika-build \
    -DWITH_FLUKA=ON \
    -S $PWD/source \
    -B $PWD/build

cd build
make
```
This will build our CORSIKA executable, named `c8_air_shower`.

## 2. Setting up the Julia environment
### [2.1] Configuring Your Environment
After downloading and seting up the required packages as described above, we now need to configure your environment. If you haven’t already, activate your Python venv using `source /path/to/tambo_venv/bin/activate`.

You should also define environemental variables that specify where `TAMBOSim` is installed and where your top-level data directory for all `TAMBOSim` simulations is located. In a shell, run
```
export TAMBOSIM_PATH=/path/to/TAMBOSim
export TAMBO_DATA_PATH=/path/to/data
```
We also need to tell `TAMBOSim` where to find `CORSIKA` and files needed by `CORSIKA`. This information is handled within a simulation configuration file. Open up the config file at `$TAMBOSIM_PATH/resources/configuration_examples/fast_test.toml` and edit
* `FLUPRO` to point to the version of `FLUKA` for `CORSIKA` to use
* `FLUFOR` to point to the version of `FORTRAN` used by `FLUKA`

### [2.2] Precompile `TAMBOSim`
Now that many of our dependencies and much of the environment is ready to go, we’ll now setup the Juila TAMBOSim package. Launch up a Julia REPL session and setup the TAMBO environment by running
```julia-repl
julia> using Pkg
julia> Pkg.activate(ENV["TAMBOSIM_PATH"])
  Activating project at "/path/to/TAMBO-MC
julia> Pkg.resolve()
...
julia> Pkg.instantiate() 
...
```
To use `TAMBOSim` run
```julia-repl
julia> using Tambo
```

### [2.3] PyCall
Now you can work on getting these Python packages to play nice with Julia. 

Start an interactive Julia session with `julia` and activate the TAMBOSim project environment as above (`using Pkg; Pkg.activate(ENV["TAMBOSIM_PATH"])`. 

To get PyCall working, first run `ENV["PYTHON"]="/path/to/tambo_env/bin/python"` (you can get this path by running `which python` on the command line while inside your TAMBO venv). This tells PyCall which Python executable it should use. Now run `using Tambo; Pkg.build("PyCall")` to build PyCall. After this completes, you’ll need to exit and reënter Julia for the changes to take effect. After reëntry, reactivate the TAMBOSim Julia environment and execute `using PyCall; pyimport("taurunner")`. If this succeeds, the PyCall installation was successful!

Note: when setting the `PYTHON` Julia environmental variable, `~` is not automatically expanded into your home directory. This means if you do not manually replace `~` with the path to your home directory, PyCall will fail to find your Python install. For I so love the users of TAMBOSim, that I sacrificed hours of my life figuring out this excentricity so that you shall not suffer as I did.

### [2.4] Snakemake
Lastly, we will install Snakemake. While all the elements in the TAMBOSim chain can be run manually, it also supports the use of Snakemake. Install Snakemake and some other needed packages by running `pip install snakemake toml h5py snakemake-executor-plugin-slurm` inside your TAMBOSim venv.

## 3. Running the Code
### [3.1] Let’s Simulate Some Events
Several examples on how to use `TAMBOSim` can be found in the `examples/` directory. For now, we will run a simulation that passes through the whole simulation chain to ensure everything is running properly.

`TAMBOSim` makes use of the `Snakemake` workflow management system. More details on `Snakemake` can be found [here](https://snakemake.github.io). By default, `TAMBOSim` will output the results of the simulation to a directory with the name of the config file in the `TAMBO_DATA_PATH` directory. For example, the name of the config file we will use here is `fast_test.toml`, so the output files will be written to `TAMBO_DATA_PATH/fast_test/`. Go ahead and create and change to this directory, creating it if needed.

To do a full run of `TAMBOSim`, execute `snakemake -p --cores 1 -s $TAMBOSIM_PATH/scripts/Snakefile $TAMBO_DATA_PATH/fast_test/triggered/2300_3700_5000_150_small/whitepaper_trigger/triggered_events_00000.jld2`. Feel free to change the number of cores to suit your machine. This will launch the full simulation chain, where `TAMBOSim` will:
* Inject tau neutrinos into the simulation volume using `TauRunner` and compute the location of the associated tau lepton decay with `PROPOSAL`
* Simulate the tau-induced air shower using `CORSIKA`
* Identify events that trigger the detector array
If all has worked as expected, Snakemake will issue you a success message and the final triggered event file will be produced.

If you run into any problems along the way, please don’t hesitate to get in contact with us. We’d love to help you get your simulation running.

### [3.2] Simulating a Lot of Events
By default, `Snakemake` can be used to generate a `TAMBOSim`  dataset in parallel on a cluster with minimal alterations to the above procedure. All you need to do is to open up the Snakefile at `$TAMBOSIM_PATH/scripts/Snakefile` and change the variable `slurm_partition` to a comma-separated list of the slurm partitions you’d like to run the simulation on. Then, simply run `snakemake -p --executor slurm --jobs N -s $TAMBOSIM_PATH/scripts/Snakefile $TAMBO_DATA_PATH/fast_test/triggered/2300_3700_5000_150_small/whitepaper_trigger/triggered_events_00000.jld2`, where `N` is the maximum number of slurm jobs to run in parallel.

###	[3.3] Changing the Simulation Configuration
Several example configuration files are provided in `resources/configuration_examples/`, including both realistic and idealized valley geometries. If you’d like to run a simulation with a different configuration, copy the configuration file into a new file, e.g. `my_configuration.toml` and alter the parameters as you see fit. Then, you can run your new simulation by running `snakemake -p --executor slurm --jobs N -s $TAMBOSIM_PATH/scripts/Snakefile $TAMBO_DATA_PATH/my_configuration/triggered/2300_3700_5000_150_small/whitepaper_trigger/triggered_events_00000.jld2`.
Notice that the way Snakemake figures out what config file to used is based on the name of output data directory you specify, so this should match the name of your configuration file.

Would you like to simulate your own custom geometry? We’re working on a script to allow a user to create custom geographies, but it’s still in the works. For now, email  [Will Thompson](mailto:will_thompson@g.harvard.edu) and he’ll be able to spin up a spline for you to use.

## 4. Running the Code with OSG 
Sometimes you'll need more compute power than what is available on fasrc or in your local cluster. 
Fortunately, we can run simulation with OSG which is a pool of computing resources from many institutions across the world. 
Here you can run 100k+ jobs. 

### [4.1] Getting an OSG account. 
Everyone who needs an account should apply for their own account! https://portal.osg-htc.org/application

They can list in the notes that they're working with the "Harvard_Delgado" project, and it will help streamline the process. The OSG people need to meet with any new users. If you have a large group who are all applying for accounts, we can set up one big meeting to get everyone onboarded as well.

### [4.2] Setting up OSG ssh for easy access 
Follow the instructions here for logging in via SSH key pair authentication: https://portal.osg-htc.org/documentation/overview/account_setup/comanage-access/. 
In `.ssh/` you can edit your `config` to include 
```
Host osg 
Hostname your.hostname.org
User your-username
IdentityFile /path/to/.ssh/your-ssh-key
ForwardX11 yes 
ForwardAgent yes
ForwardX11Trusted yes
```
Make sure your ssh-key pub file is readable (`chmod 600 your-ssh-key.pub`). 
Then for an extra layer of convenience, so that you don't have to provide your SSH key password, you can type `ssh-add ~/.ssh/your-ssh-key`.
Now, when you type `ssh osg` it should immediately take you to `/home/username`.
